# To use the react-date-range date picker in a local language, you'll need to import and configure the locale from date-fns

# Other Locales
If you want to use a different language, simply replace fr with the relevant locale code. Here are some examples:

English (default): No locale import is needed; it's already the default.
Spanish: import { es } from 'date-fns/locale';
German: import { de } from 'date-fns/locale';
Japanese: import { ja } from 'date-fns/locale';
